## Issues

Use a markdown table with columns: Original | Issue | Suggested Fix

Categories of issues to check (in priority order):
1. **Grammar errors** — subject-verb agreement, tense, articles, prepositions
2. **Chinglish / translation artifacts** — phrasing that sounds like direct Chinese-to-English translation
3. **Unnatural expressions** — grammatically correct but not how a native speaker would say it
4. **Word choice upgrades** — where a more precise or idiomatic word exists

## Rewritten Version

Provide the full corrected text with all fixes applied.

## Quick Verdict

One sentence: overall quality assessment (clarity, fluency, tone appropriateness).
